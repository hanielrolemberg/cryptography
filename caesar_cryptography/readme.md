# Caesar Cipher

This project implements a simple Caesar Cipher, a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.

## Overview

The Caesar Cipher is one of the earliest and simplest methods of encryption. This Python script allows you to encrypt or decrypt text by shifting the letters by a specified number of positions.

## How It Works

The script defines a function `caesar_cipher` that takes a text string and a shift value as input. It processes each character in the text, shifting alphabetical characters by the specified amount while leaving non-alphabetical characters unchanged.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the script.
3. Run the script using Python:
    ```sh
    python caesar_cipher.py
    ```
4. Follow the prompts to enter the text you want to encrypt or decrypt and the shift value.

## Example

```sh
Enter the text to be encrypted/decrypted: Hello, World!
Enter the number of positions to shift: 3
Encrypted/Decrypted text: Khoor, Zruog!
